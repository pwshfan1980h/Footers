    flavor: 'Every sandwich man worth his salt has parked at Sector 7 at least once. The lunch rush here is honest work — commuters, dock hands, freight jockeys all wanting something quick between transfers. Nobody orders anything fancy, nobody stiffs you either. Old Manny used to say this was the only spot in the verse where you could run a clean shift and still sleep at night. The station board lists forty-two registered food vendors. Most of them quit inside a week.',

    flavor: 'Cygnus never sleeps and neither will you. Three commercial rings, two hundred docking berths, and every single soul on board seems to want lunch at the same time. The corporate types here eat fast and move on — don\'t expect thank-you notes or big tips, just volume. Pure, relentless volume. They say a sandwich man named Deeks once filled ninety orders in a single shift here. They also say he never came back. The secret to Cygnus is simple: keep your hands moving or go home.',

They eat like it\'s their last meal because out here, some days it almost is. The miners don\'t come often but they come hungry, and they remember who fed them well. A good sub at Pickaxe buys you loyalty money can\'t.',

They order one sandwich a day, maybe two, and they want it perfect. No rush. They\'ll wait. But when you nail it — the right bread, the right sauce, everything stacked clean — they tip like they\'re trying to get rid of money. The Violet Nebula is where sandwich men go to breathe.

Tips are an afterthought. You make your money here on pure throughput: stack fast, serve faster, don\'t stop to think. New Geneva will teach you speed or it will bury you.

They want specific cheeses, particular sauces, treatments done just so. Every order feels like a final exam. But clear the ticket clean and watch what happens — these folks tip more on a single sandwich than most stations pay in a full shift. The catch? Mess up once and they remember your truck number.
